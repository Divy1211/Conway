# Conway's Game of Life
1. This is conway's game of life recreated in java

# Prerequisites

1. You need to install and run this code in Java

# Rules of the game
This is a 0 player game, only the initial state affects the game cycle.
There are a few rules that govern this game  

1. A live cell is a cell filled with black colour.
2. A cell lives if it has two or three neighbours.
3. A cell dies if it has two neighbours as if by underpopulation.
4. A cell dies if it has more than three neighbours as if by overpopulation.
5. A cell is born if it has exactly three neighbours as if by reproduction.
6. Each time a pass is done the state changes according to the rules.

# About The Program
1. Change the state of a cell by clicking it.
2. Use the text field for changing the speed in milliseconds. Default is 50 milliseconds.
3. Click start to begin and stop to end and clear to clear the board.
